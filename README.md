## Introduction
Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). This project demonstrates how to implement linear regression using gradient descent for optimization.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
